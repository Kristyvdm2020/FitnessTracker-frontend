//Bri, I think it would be great if we could have a mission statement of sorts like 
//Here at WERKIT, we believe in spreading positivity and encouraging our patrons
//to enjoy working out by making a customizable routine or following one of our many
//routines posted by other patrons. 
//and then partway down, putting
